    "- Why some DISCHTIME is nagative ? \n",
    "- “Organ donor accounts are sometimes created for patients who died in the hospital. These are distinct hospital admissions with very short, sometimes negative lengths of stay. Furthermore, their DEATHTIME is frequently the same as the earlier patient admission’s DEATHTIME.” (“The admissions table | MIMIC”)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why should we treat the DIAGNOSIS CAREFULLY?\n",
    "- \"The diagnosis is usually assigned by the admitting clinician\" means that when a patient is admitted to a hospital, the clinician will make an initial assumption which based on their experience or basic examinations, such as lab results. Therefore, different admitting clinicians may have different opinions about the patient’s condition.Systematic ontology refers to a standardized classification system for diseases. Such as the ICD (International Classification of Diseases),SNOMED CT（Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms, LOINC（Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes. We may observe some issues in this table:: 1. The one disease with the different names.  2. Different standard for one disease. 3. Without the uniform code which is hard for following analysis. \n",

    "#### Explaination of the different columns:\n",
    "- SUBJECT_ID, HADM_ID\n",
    "> Each row of this table contains a unique HADM_ID, which represents a single patient’s admission to the hospital. HADM_ID ranges from 1000000 - 1999999. It is possible for this table to have duplicate SUBJECT_ID, indicating that a single patient had multiple admissions to the hospital. The ADMISSIONS table can be linked to the PATIENTS table using SUBJECT_ID.\n",
    "- ADMITTIME \n",
    "> provides the date and time the patient was admitted to the hospital\n",
    "\n",
    "- DISCHTIME\n",
    "> provides the date and time the patient was discharged from the hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DEATHTIME\n",
    "> is only present if the patient died in-hospital, and is almost always the same as the patient’s __DISCHTIME__ (Note: There may contain some difference because of the typographical errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ADMISSION_TYPE\n",
    "> There are 3 types of the admission: ‘ELECTIVE’, ‘URGENT’, ‘NEWBORN’ or ‘EMERGENCY’.\n",
    "__Emergency/urgent__  indicate unplanned medical care, and are often collapsed into a single category in studies. __Elective__ indicates a previously planned hospital admission. __NEWBORN__ means that the babies and mom will  get two different __HADM_ID__\n",
    "\n",
    "- ADMISSION_LOCATION\n",
    "> ADMISSION_LOCATION provides information about the previous location of the patient prior to arriving at the hospital. There are 9 possible values:\n",
    "- EMERGENCY ROOM ADMIT\n",
    "- TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM \n",
    "- TRANSFER FROM OTHER HEALT  \n",

    "- HMO REFERRAL/SICK  \n",
    "- PHYS REFERRAL/NORMAL DELI  \n",
    "\n",
    "- HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG\n",
    "> indicates whether the patient died within the given hospitalization. 1 indicates death in the hospital, and 0 indicates survival to hospital discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DIAGNOSIS\n",
    "> column provides a preliminary, free text diagnosis for the patient on hospital admission.The diagnosis is usually assigned by the admitting clinician and does not use a systematic ontology.\n",
    "\n",
    "- INSURANCE, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, MARITAL_STATUS, ETHNICITY\n",
    "> The INSURANCE, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, MARITAL_STATUS, ETHNICITY columns describe patient demographics. These columns occur in the ADMISSIONS table as they are originally sourced from the admission, discharge, and transfers (ADT) data from the hospital database. The values occasionally change between hospital admissions (HADM_ID) for a single patient (SUBJECT_ID). This is reasonable for some fields (e.g. MARITAL_STATUS, RELIGION), but less reasonable for others (e.g. ETHNICITY).\n",
